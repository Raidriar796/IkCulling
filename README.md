# ResoniteIkCulling

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that disables the IK of Users who are behind you or far away. Includes optional IK throttling.


## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
2. Place [ResoniteIKCulling.dll](https://github.com/Raidriar796/ResoniteIkCulling/releases/latest/download/ResoniteIKCulling.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.

## Info
This is a fork of [IKCulling](https://github.com/KyuubiYoru/IkCulling/) for that aims to improve and maintain the mod.
