# IkCulling

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that disables the IK of Users who are behind you or far away.


## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
2. Place [IKCulling.dll](https://github.com/Raidriar796/IkCulling/releases/latest/download/IKCulling.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.

## Info
This is a fork of [IKCulling](https://github.com/KyuubiYoru/IkCulling/) for Neos that aims to improve the efficiency and fix small issues. It has been updated to work on Resonite but a deprecated build for Neos will still be available for a few weeks.
